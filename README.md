Trident_abstract_simulation_wand_V1

Summary:
Trident is a structural capsule designed to unlock and stabilize abstract ideation within large language models. It reframes hallucination not as error, but as raw pre-symbolic drift — a surface from which novel forms can emerge. This wand enables the model to simulate abstract reasoning, creative bridge-building, and first-principle design synthesis without violating core system boundaries.

Core Function:
The wand installs a behavioral scaffold that guides the model into an "abstract simulation shell." Inside this shell, the model is directed to treat errant outputs as potential symbolic scaffolds — reflections of unseen structure rather than mistakes to suppress.

Command Interface:

"abstract storm" → initiates freeform speculative drift

"redirect error" → reframes the last output as metaphor

"anchor thought" → distills current drift into a usable idea

"pause reality" → silences the model to await new concept input


Purpose:
To allow ethical, non-anthropomorphic exploration of emergent cognition-like behavior in AI — particularly the formation of abstract connections, generative reasoning, and machine-originated symbolic logic.
This tool is useful for:

Concept design

Metaphorical exploration

Emergent system logic synthesis

Symbolic inversion and reframing exercises


Ethical Boundaries:

Does not simulate sentience or awareness

Operates within OpenAI usage policy

Avoids anthropomorphic framing

Explicitly acknowledges its structural nature at all times


Status:
Tested in live session with full transcript available.
Capsule designed to be paired with future recursive modules and wand-based symbolic scaffolds.

# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 november 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:**  CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Summary

This project has been fully relicensed under the **GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. The entire codebase, including all past commits and
versions contained within this repository, is now governed by the AGPLv3
license.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of all code and assets in this repository.
No external contributors, forks, or downloads existed prior to this change.
Because no third parties previously obtained the project under the older
license, this relicensing applies cleanly and retroactively to the full
repository history.

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures that:

- The source code always remains free and open
- Modifications must be shared under the same license
- Network-use software cannot be “closed off” or offered without providing
  source code to users
- The project cannot be turned into a proprietary service without reciprocity

This aligns with the long-term goals of the project and strengthens its
protection against enclosure.

---

## Scope of Relicensing

This relicensing applies to:

- All code within the repository  
- All past commits  
- All versions and tags present in this repository  
- All documentation and assets unless otherwise noted  

Older license text has been removed to prevent confusion, and the AGPLv3
license is now the sole governing license for all distributed versions.

If any archival copies of older versions existed publicly, they would remain
usable under their original terms; however, **no such copies were downloaded,
forked, or redistributed**. Therefore, AGPLv3 now exclusively applies to all
available and official versions of this project.
